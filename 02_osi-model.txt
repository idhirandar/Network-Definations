OSI model is a refferance model which provide a framework to understand how devices are connected on a TCP/Ip Network.

seven layers of OSI model :-

7. Application Layer 
6. Presentation Layer
5. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer 
3. Network Layer 
2. Datalink Layer 
1. Physcal Layer 

| all layers definations | 
+-----------------------+

1. define how bits move from one devic to another ( how to send and reviced bits ).

2. encapsulates a packet in a frame and  (add source and destination address).

3. logical addressing, path determination, routing,  

4. control the reliablity of connection through :-
         
  	a. Segmentation 
	b. Flow control
	c. error control / checksum

5. defines how to establish and terminate a session between the two systems.

6. defines data formats. Compression and encryption are defined at this layer.

7. this layer is the closest to the user. It enables network applications to communicate with other network applications.


osi is a refferance model which help us to understand when a connecton happen between 2 diffrance devices how .
